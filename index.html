        <p>Biography: Dev mission is a life changing opportunity for me, where I as part of an underrepresented immigrant coming from Algeria is developing skills that are necessary in most jobs and careers, such as communication .
    This program is for those who are passionate to take their life to the next level, that's why I joined.
    As for me, this program not only teaches me tech skills but most importantly professionalism.
    I see myself as a youth who speaks three different languages and a dialect, and this opportunity would strengthen my relationship with the world out there.
    As I am passionate to learn and gain experience, I also have the intentions to innovate, and Dev Mission provides a space for those who are in a learning process and have the desires to innovate.
    I also see myself  as a community person, where I try to learn about the community and think about problem solving. It is in <Dev Mission> where I learned that working with others and being a problem solver is a must in any field related to tech.
    As I am in this program, I want to be able to develop new skills that would help navigate my daily life and my work related life but most importantly is to give back to the community that once was there for me.</p>
